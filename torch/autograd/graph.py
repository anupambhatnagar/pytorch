class saved_tensors_hooks():
    """Context-manager that sets a pair of pack / unpack hooks for saved tensors.

    Use this context-manager to define how intermediary results of an operation
    should be packed before saving, and unpacked on retrieval.

    In that context, the ``pack_hook`` function will be called everytime an
    operation saves a tensor for backward (this includes intermediary results
    saved using
    :func:`~torch.autograd.function._ContextMethodMixin.save_for_backward` but
    also those recorded by a PyTorch-defined operation). The output of
    ``pack_hook`` is then stored in the computation graph instead of the
    original tensor.

    The ``unpack_hook`` is called when the saved tensor needs to be accessed,
    namely when executing :func:`torch.Tensor.backward()` or
    :func:`torch.autograd.grad()`. It takes as argument the *packed* object
    returned by ``pack_hook`` and should return a tensor which has the same
    content as the original tensor (passed as input to the corresponding
    ``pack_hook``).

    The hooks should have the following signatures:

        pack_hook(tensor: Tensor) -> Any

        unpack_hook(Any) -> Tensor

    where the return value of ``pack_hook`` is a valid input to ``unpack_hook``.

    In general, you want ``unpack_hook(pack_hook(t))`` to be equal to ``t`` in terms
    of value, size, dtype and device.

    Example::

        >>> def pack_hook(x):
        ...     print("Packing", x)
        ...     return x
        >>>
        >>> def unpack_hook(x):
        ...     print("Unpacking", x)
        ...     return x
        >>>
        >>> a = torch.ones(5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> b = torch.ones(5, requires_grad=True) * 2
        >>> with torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks(pack_hook, unpack_hook):
        ...     y = a * b

        Packing tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>)

def allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors():
    """Context manager under which mutating tensors saved for backward is allowed

    Under this context manager, tensors saved for backward are cloned on mutation,
    so the original version can still be used during backward. Normally, mutating a tensor
    saved for backward will result in an error raised when it's used during backward.

    To ensure the correct behavior, both the forward and backward should be run under
    the same context manager.

    returns:
        An _AllowMutationOnSavedContext object storing the state managed by this
        context manager. This object can be useful for debugging purposes. The state
        managed by the context manager is automatically cleared upon exiting.

    Example::

        >>> import torch
        >>> with torch.autograd.graph.allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors():
        ...     # forward
        ...     a = torch.ones(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
        ...     b = a.clone()
        ...     out = (b**2).sum()
